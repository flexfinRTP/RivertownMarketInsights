                        Too many advisors take the money run.
                        <br><br>Have you seen the rate that digital money is replacing the need for traditional financial vehicles?
                        <br><br>It is important now more then ever to support and serve the clients.
                        The clients can go and get their desired product themselves now, but they continue to do business with us because of the customer service. People today have the ability to be there own bank, be their own investor, manage their retirement thanks to the new digital age.

                        How would you feel if you gave a million dollars of your hard earned money to a professional who would only check in with you about your money, once a year?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clients want constant communication with their advisors. Email is still the most effective way of sending important information on a regular basis.
                        It is paramount to keep in constant contact with your client to maintain trust and retain their business. Recommendations include social media posts, blogs, newsletters, regular emails and calls with clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Financial advisors have multiple demographics to consider when sending out impersonal communication.
                        There are three age demographics to consider when choosing the appropriate communication channel. Not only is choosing the correct channel important but providing multiple communication channels is shown to be noticeably effective when engaging clientele or potential clients.

                        It will be important to understand how to communicate effectively in the fast-paced financial world.
                        The communication in the financial world needs to be brief, exact, and contain only pertinent information. It is important to have effective meaning in your communication in the financial world because it is dealing with a very serious topic that almost every single person on earth is affected by, money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When it comes down to money, people do not mess around so improving your semantic meaning by being completely honest and direct with people about their money will be received well.
                        Tip-toeing or throwing misunderstandings to throw off people looking for answer will not be tolerated and will have serious consequences.
                        These include legal action by your client, legal action by the regulatory bodies, loss of reputation, and many others.

                        Some great quotes to tie together what we have discussed:
                    </p>
                    <p id="quoteP">
                        Quote: “Think about your closest friends. If you send them a generic text once a quarter, your relationship might suffer.
                        You may wonder how much they really care about you. It’s not going to be any different with client relationships.”
                        <br><br>
                        Quote: “In the end, all your client communication should have one underlying trait—it should focus on what clients value so you speak truth into their circumstances.”
                        <br><br>
                        Quote: “The bottom line, though, is that clearly the importance of not just effective client communication overall,
                        but the importance of choosing the right channels and variety of communication channels, a significant challenge given the proliferation of tools and options available.”

                        The financial world and its requisites for being successful are constantly changing and that’s what makes the market exciting.

                        I have had interest in how money works in our social economy since I was a rebellious teen with the thought of money is the root of all evil. I then matured my studies with Austrian economics, how the fed services our debt, and other current monetary problems that threaten our financial freedom.
